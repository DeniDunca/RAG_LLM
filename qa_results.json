        "answer": "Digoxin's chemical mechanism of action involves inhibiting **sodium-potassium ATPase**, an enzyme responsible for regulating the balance of sodium and potassium inside cells. This inhibition leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium, which in turn stimulates **sodium-calcium exchange**, resulting in an increased intracellular concentration of calcium. The increased calcium levels enhance the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction, contributing to its **positive inotropic action**. Additionally, digoxin has indirect effects on the cardiovascular system through its influence on the **autonomic nervous system**, including a **vagomimetic action** and **baroreceptor sensitization**, which help reduce sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system activity."

        "question": "What enzyme does digoxin inhibit, and what is its physiological effect?",
        "answer": "Digoxin inhibits **sodium-potassium ATPase**, an enzyme that regulates the quantity of sodium and potassium inside cells. \n\nThe physiological effect of this inhibition is an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium, which subsequently leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium (via stimulation of sodium-calcium exchange). This cascade of events results in several pharmacologic consequences, including:\n\n1. **Positive inotropic action**: Increased force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction.\n2. **Neurohormonal deactivating effect**: Decreased activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system.\n3. **Vagomimetic effect**: Slowing of the heart rate and decreased conduction velocity through the atrioventricular (AV) node.\n\nThese effects are responsible for digoxin's therapeutic actions in heart failure and atrial arrhythmias."
